Shiv: shell access everywhere.

Shiv allows you to run shell commands from any text box.
When started, it listens for keyboard inputs, on Enter it will run the command and write the output.

The recommended way to use shiv is to bind it to a key combination.

Examples:
  ‚Ä¢ On demand python shell:
    $ shiv "python -c"
  ‚Ä¢ Query ChatGPT:
    $ shiv "sgpt"
  ‚Ä¢ On demand calculator and consersions:
    $ shiv "qalc -t"
  ‚Ä¢ ASCII art:
    $ shiv "figlet"
